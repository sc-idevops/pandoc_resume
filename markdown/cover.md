Greetings Cotality Team,
    I was recently informed about a new opportunity at your company for a DevOps engineer. After reviewing the qualifications I believe I would be an excellent fit with your team. Much of my experience and education was built upon linux including common tools you use daily such as kubernetes and airflow. I further enhanced these skills at my current placement with Pricewaterhouse Coopers, as most of their workflow is powered by airflow directing kubernetes pods. I'm familiar with postgres SQL databases which I work with on a day to day basis at PwC. I make use of confluence to document changes to and creation of new standard operating procedures.  

I'm also intrigued by the sheer volume of data that you process and how such massive datasets are handled. I'm also familiar with the inner workings of real estate having served as an office manager for a real estate company, which would be helpful knowledge for a candidate to have. 

Automation was part of my core training in devops
